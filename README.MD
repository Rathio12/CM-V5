# 🤖 Welcome to Fluffy Bot

**// THANKS FOR ADDING ME TO YOUR SERVER!! //**  
*// Still under development – please don't be frustrated if something doesn't work at first //*

## 📌 Quick Start

1. **Setup Logging Channels:** Use `/setup` to configure your server's logging channels.  
2. **Fun Commands:** Use `?meme` for a quick Reddit meme.  
3. **Manage Cogs:** Use `/cog_list` and `/cog_enable` / `/cog_disable` to manage bot features.  
4. **Custom Reminders:** *(Not fully ready yet)* Use `/set_reminder <hour> <minute> <message>` to set reminders. *Use at your own risk during testing.*  
5. **GitHub Repository Info:** Use `/repo <github_link>` to fetch info about any GitHub repository.  
6. **Quotes / Facts:**  
   - `/quote` — Get a random quote or fact from the internet.  
   - **Scheduled Posting:** Admins can set a channel using `/set_quote_channel` for automated quotes/facts every 2 hours.  
   - Sources include **Quote Garden API, ZenQuotes API, and Reddit** (`/r/quotes` & `/r/facts`).

## ⚠️ Notes
- Features are still in development and may change.  
- Always make sure you have the proper permissions to use certain commands.  
- Quotes/Facts rely on online APIs and Reddit; if a source is down, fallback handling ensures the bot still works.
